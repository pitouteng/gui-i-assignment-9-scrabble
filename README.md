GUI Programming I

The single row scrabble is implemented. Tiles are drawn from the 100 tiles pool at random.
The randomly selected tiles and placed initially on the tile holder. Each tile can be
dragged to the any block of the board and snap to the board. Tile can also be dragged
back to the tile holder. Everytime a drag stop, the program recalulate the score.
When the submit button is pressed, the tiles placed on board are removed, and from the
each removed tile, new tile is drawn from the same bag 7 tiles are initially drawn.
The score accumulates to the total score and the score reset. When the there no more
tiles in the bag, an alert pops up and the user can click ok to the restart the game.
